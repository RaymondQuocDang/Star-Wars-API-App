# Star Wars API Application

This application uses the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to display Star Wars characters and a few of their attributes. The application has two main parts. The first one allows you to search up characters by name. The second part of the application displays a table of Star Wars character, up to ten at a time. 

I used react to build this application by combining multiple components together. Bootstrap was used to do basic styling. I used fetch to get information from SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/) and displayed it on screen. In future I could revisit this project and further improve the styling as I mainly focused on functionality this time around. I also may give axios for fetching information. I was already part way through building this project when I realized that was a tool I could utilize.

Using the web page is quite simple. For the search function you just need to type in a name of a character. It doesn't have to be a full name but the more exact the name, the more precise your search will be. If you put in the exact name then the search may return to you one character while entering a partial name could pull up a list of characters. The other part of the project is the 10 character long table. You can hit the next and previous buttons to maneuver through the pages and view all the characters that are listed in SWAPI. The page will display the character name, birth date, height, mass, homeworld and species.
